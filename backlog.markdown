# Golo backlog

Not everything is deemed to be implemented...

## Language

* Support invocations with either () or {}? Could be fun for DSL-style constructs.

* Annotations.

## Runtime

* Cache method / function resolution in the runtime support classes.

* Investigate adaptive handling of types.

## stdlib

* Tests

## Internals

* Concurrent compilation?

* Look if thread locals could not be judiciously used in some places.
